Pumping Iron is a workout tracking app with integrated set and rep counting sensors. You can keep track of your exercises over time,
and easily view your progress.


On Startup, the application has example workout data stored.

## CALENDAR PAGE

Upon clicking the "CALENDAR" button, you will be taken to a view of a calendar.
This calendar displays every day that you have worked out in a given month.

Click on a day to view a graph showing the exercises, weights, and reps that you performed on that day.
From here, you may click "return to main" in order to go back to the home screen.

## ADD NEW WORKOUT PAGE
Upon clicking the "ADD NEW WORKOUT" button, you will be taken to a new page.
From here, you may choose a muscle group from the dropdown menu.
This action will populate the second dropdown menu with a list of exercises related to that muscle.


From here, you may click "ADD SET". This will begin the process of your first set in Pumping Iron.
Your Set Number is displayed to the left. 
Now you may increment or decrement your current exercise weight with the "++5#" or "--5#" buttons.

Now, affix your phone to your forearm, click "START," perform your set, then click "STOP." 
Your set data has now been stored.
Now click "ADD SET" to begin your next set!

We have also added a button to manually add reps to your set by choosing a number from the "Enter Reps" dropdown, then clicking
"MANUALLY ADD REPS."

From here, you may once again click "ADD SET" to continue on your current exercise,
you may choose a new muscle and/or exercise, or you may go back to the home page by clicking "BACK TO MAIN"


## GRAPH PAGE
Clicking "GRAPH" takes you to a new page. 
From here, you may choose from two options in the dropdown.

"Sets, Reps and Weight" shows you a list of all the days that you have worked out, and allows you to select a date to display
that day's workout data on a graph. 

Every Dot is a set, the two axes tell you the weight and pounds. Every Colored Line is an exercise.
The exercise color is able to be referred to in the legend below.

"Max Weight" allows you to select a muscle group, then a muscle to populate the graph with 
the max weight lifted per exercise per workout day.


## CURRENT EXERCISES PAGE

Clicking "CURRENT EXERCISES" displays you a list view of today's workouts, so you can keep track of what you've already done today.
